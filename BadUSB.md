(in hex)

```python
device.write(arr)
```
The first byte of `arr` is the Report ID (value 2).  
If `len(arr) > 9`, every 10th, 20th, etc., byte is also a Report ID (2) and will be ignored.  
This means that for the first nine elements of `arr`, there are eight data bytes. Starting from the 10th byte, each segment consists of one Report ID followed by nine data bytes.
**The simplest approach is to always use an array of size 9, as the firmware is designed to handle this format.**
These results were tested on macOS; behavior on Linux may differ slightly but is generally the same.

- 01 XX XX XX XX XXâ€¦ Set Name
- 02 Clear BadUSB Script
- 03 XX XX Start writing script + script length + CRC32 + ...

  - FF XX delay(20ms per unit)
  - FE XX Modifier
  - FD finish script
  - other: keycode
- 04 XX XX XX XX YY YY YY YY ZZ
  - XX write address
  - YY content
  - ZZ type, bytes, half word, or word

- 05 XX XX XX XX ZZ
  - XX read address
